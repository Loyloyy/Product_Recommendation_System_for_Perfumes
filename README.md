# Product_Recommendation_System_for_Perfumes <Ongoing project (Resumed in 2021), Creating Recommendation Engine now!>

### Motivation
My goal for this project includes the following
- Find if there is any correlation between a perfume's popularity and potential available data such as accords, longetivity and silage to name a few
- To maximise my time at home during my country's lockdown (circuit breaker)
- Pick up web scraping knowledge and create my own dataset
- Further hone my data engineering and wrangling skills and knowledge
- Further develop my deep learning knowledge with Tensorflow and Pytorch
- Learn more about cloud deployment solutions

### Synopsis
One of my main hobbies in the past was a fragrance hobby. I have always found perfumes to be a very intriguing as it can make us feel so much just with smell, similar to how music does. Hence, with my knowledge of machine learning, I intend to compile my very own dataset and find potential insights as to what people love in perfumes and what are the potential factors that contributes to a perfume's popularity.

### Note
As web scraping is something that is in the grey area, please do not abuse it with this knowledge and scrap responsibly

### More information
As this is still a work in progress (still at web scraping), I have only uploaded the different types of scrapers I have created. My current usage will be the Selenium method. Although it is much slower compared to Scrapy, it allows me to also learn more about the different brands and perfumes out there as I constantly update the script.
